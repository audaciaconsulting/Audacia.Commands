# Overview

`Audacia.Commands` is an implementation of the command pattern. It includes functionality to validate and execute commands.

# Usage

## Command and Command Handlers

A 'command' is generally a Plain Old CLR Object (POCO) that represents some kind of action that needs to be performed (e.g. `AddCustomer`). Each command should implement the `ICommand` interface, which is a marker interface.

In order to execute a command the `ICommandHandler<T>` interface must be implemented, where the generic parameter `T` is the type of the command. For example using the `AddCustomer` example above, the handler implementation would look like this:
```csharp
public class AddCustomerHandler : ICommandHandler<AddCustomer>
{
     // Implementation here
}
```

## Results

The result of a command is communicated back to the caller via a `CommandResult` (or `CommandResult<T>`) object. `CommandResult` contains a boolean flag indicating whether execution of the command was successful or not, as well as a collection of errors.

Some commands need to return data to the caller, which can be achieved by returning a `CommandResult<T>` object, where `T` is the type of data being returned. For example, if the command is adding a new entity you may need to return the ID of the newly created database record, in which case you may return a `CommandResult<int>`.

## Dispatching Commands

In order to execute a command you can consume an `ICommandHandler<T>` instance directly. The `ICommandDispatcher` interface (and its default implementation `CommandDispatcher`) provides another mechanism to execute commands. `ICommandDispatcher` can be passed a command of any type and it will create the necessary handler and execute it. Creation of a handler requires an implementation of `ICommandHandlerFactory`.

### Command Handling Pipelines

Cross-cutting concerns can be addressed using generic handlers. `ExceptionHandlingDecorator` and `ValidatingDecorator` are provided implementations.

## Validators

Validation can be performed by implementing the `ICommandValidator<T>` interface and injecting this into the handler. Validation is discussed in more depth below.

## Audacia.Commands.Validation
**NOTE**: This part of the library is intended to make validation commands easier, but you can use it for any class object.

### Example usage:
```csharp
using Audacia.Commands.Validation;
...
var model = new ValidationModel<FooPostCommand>();

if(!model.IsModelNull())
{
     model.Property(m => m.Name)
          .IsRequired()
          .HasMaxLength(25);

     model.Property(m => m.SomeProperty)
          .Property(c => c.SomeChildProperty)
          .MustBeGreaterThan(3);
}

return await model.ToCommandResultAsync();
```

### IValidationModel
A validation model is a collection of validation results for provided class properties and validation logic.

#### Properties
- **AllErrors** `IEnumerable<string>`
All validation errors regardless of property.

- **ModelErrors** `IDictionary<string, IEnumerable<string>>`
Key value pairs of Property Name and Validation Errors, 
Any errors against the Model uses a blank string as the Property Name.

- **IsValid** `bool`
Is true if there are no errors.

- **ModelName** `string`
User friendly model name.

#### Methods
- **IsModelNull** `bool IsModelNull()`
Checks if the model is null,
Adds a validation error when null.

- **Property** `ValidationProperty Property(Expression<Func<TModel, TProperty>> property, string displayName);`
Creates a validation property from which you can fluently attach validation extensions.

- **AddModelError** `void AddModelError(string propertyName, string errorMessage)`
Adds a validation error for a property.

- **ToCommandResultAsync** `Task<CommandResult> ToCommandResultAsync()`
Appends any validation errors to the command result.

---

### Validation Property
A validation property is a model to validate a single property.

#### Properties
- **ModelName** `string`
User friendly model name.

- **PropertyName** `string`
Name of the property.

- **DisplayName** `string`
User friendly property name.

- **Value** `TProperty`
Property value.

#### Methods
- **AddError** `void AddError(string message)`
Adds a validation error to the property.

- **Property** `Property(Expression<Func<TProperty, TChild>> property, string displayName)`
Creates a child validation property on a property object.

---

### Extensions Methods

- **AlreadyExists** `AlreadyExists(bool exists)`
Adds a model error explaining the value already exists.
This only adds a message, you need to provide the logic for if your unique value exists or not.

- **IsRequired** `IsRequired()`
Validates that the property has been filled in.

- **IsRequired** `IsRequired()` (collections only)
Validates that there is at least one element on a collection.

- **HasMaxLength** `HasMaxLength(int length)` (strings only)
Validates that the property is not longer than the max length.

- **HasMaxLength** `HasMaxLength(int length)` (collections only)
Validates that the collection is not longer than the max length.

- **HasMinLength** `HasMinLength(int length)` (strings only)
Validates that the property is not shorter than the min length.

- **HasMinLength** `HasMinLength(int length)` (collections only)
Validates that the collection is not shorter than the min length.

- **MatchesPattern** `MatchesPattern(string pattern, params string[] conditions)` (strings only)
Validates that the property matches a given regex pattern.

- **MustBeAValidId** `MustBeAValidId()` (int?)
Validates that the Id is not null or less than zero.

- **MustBeGreaterThan** `MustBeGreaterThan(TProperty number)`
Validates that the property is greater than the given value. (IComparable)

- **MustBeGreaterThanOrEqualTo** `MustBeGreaterThanOrEqualTo(TProperty number)` (IComparable)
Validates that the property is greater than or equal to the given value.

- **MustBeLessThan** `MustBeLessThan(TProperty number)` (IComparable)
Validates that the property is less than the given value.

- **MustBeLessThanOrEqualTo** `MustBeLessThanOrEqualTo(TProperty number)` (IComparable)
Validates that the property is less than or equal to the given value.
